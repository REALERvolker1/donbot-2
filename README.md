# DonBot

This is a github repo because I accidentally deleted the old one and I want to make sure that doesn't happen again.

to build, make sure you have node.js installed as well as pnpm and typescript. run `pnpm i` and then `npm run c` to get started.



You will need some secret files though that I can't tell you about like the bot token. Also, you will have to change the IDs ofc
